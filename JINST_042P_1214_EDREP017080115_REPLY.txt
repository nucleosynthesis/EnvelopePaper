1) [I think we decided this meant the ratio of the likelihoods at the true
value and the best fit value. We separate the latter by right and wrong 
functions, while the former is the value on the envelope, irrespective of
the function which is contributing. Nick or Matt will produce a plot of this.]

2) [Matt will try going up to N_par=8, so adding two more polynomial and 
Laurent functions and one more power law and exponential function. We also
need to make a note to the editor, as follows.]

We think that the suggestion in paragraph 2 to add an extra uncertainty for
functions which were not considered is not in the spirit of the method described
in the paper. It would not be quantifiable and so and value could not be
defended. This goes against our aim of reducing arbitrary choices, as stated in
Sec 1 of the paper. We believe we have a reasonable range of functions to 
describe the data well; others were tried but gave poor fits and so were not
used in practise (although by definition they would have not contributed to the
envelope if they had been included anyway). Hence, since we know of no way to 
give a value to a non-contributing-function uncertainty, we prefer not to 
include this in the paper.

3) The meaning of optimal has been explained further. Text has been added to
Sec 4.5 in paragraphs 1 and 4.

4) [This was left to think about before deciding on our response.]

5) The text in Sec 5 has been shortened considerably. Since this section then
because very short, it was merged with Sec 6 to make a combined "Discussion and
conclusions" section.

6) Some discussion on the biases in Figure 12 has been added on Sec 4.4, 
resulting in changes to paragraphs 1 and 2.

7) List item 1 in Sec 4.1 has been rewritten to give more detail on the method
for calculating chi^prime-squared.

8) [Nick will find the best fit parameter values and add them to the text.]

9) [Nick will fix Fig 8 but removing "+ correction" on both y axes.]
