\abstract{
A common problem in data analysis is that the functional form, as well as the parameter values,
of the underlying model which should describe a dataset is not known {\it a priori}. In these cases some
extra uncertainty must be assigned to the extracted parameters of interest due to lack of exact knowledge of the functional form of the model.
A method for assigning an appropriate error is presented. The method is based on
considering the choice of functional form as a discrete nuisance parameter which is
profiled in an analogous way to continuous nuisance parameters. The bias and coverage of this method are shown to be good when applied to
a realistic example.
