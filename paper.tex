\abstract{
A common problem in high energy physics is the extraction of a signal over a 
potentially large background. In cases where the background functional form is not
{\it a priori} known, then some extra uncertainty must be assigned to the
signal parameters because of this lack of knowledge.
A method for assigning an error from this cause is presented. It is based on
treating the lack of knowledge of the functional form as a discrete nuisance parameter which is
profiled in an equivalent way to continuous nuisance parameters. This
effectively means an ``envelope'' is found which encompasses the lowest
log-likelihood values for any given
signal parameter. The bias and coverage of this method are shown to be good when applied to 
a realistic example.
